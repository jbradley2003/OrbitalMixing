# Orbital Mixing

This is a project for COMP225 - Software Design and Development. The activity is designed for General Chemistry students who wish to learn more about bonding theory and how different atomic orbitals interact. In effect, we are providing visualization for the constructive and destructive overlap in regions of an orbital's wavefunction. The wavefunction is an idea from quantum mechanics that describes the probability distribution of the location of a particle, in this case, we are talking about electrons.
