# Orbital Mixing Activity

This is a project for COMP225 - Software Design and Development. The activity is designed for General Chemistry students who wish to learn more about bonding theory and how different atomic orbitals interact. In effect, this project aims to provide a visualization of the constructive and destructive overlap in regions of an orbital's wavefunction for diatomics (molecules with two atoms). The wavefunction is an idea from quantum mechanics that describes the probability distribution of the location of a particle, in this case, we are talking about electrons.

This web app is built with the p5.js graphics library. Ideally, I will eventually rework the graphics using WebGL.
